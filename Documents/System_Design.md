## System Design

## Goal
Getting used to working in a project is one of the most important steps that a person should take when they start working in the software industry. There are a variety of tools that can help them manage their projects, such as Git, Trello, and GitLab.

The goal of this program is to provide participants with the necessary skills to succeed in today's volatile world, where technology is constantly improving and constantly changing. It will also help them make the life of their admin easier.

We also want to make sure that the application is not only about the manipulation of the experience, but also the ease of use of the website. This is because if a user enjoys the design and is able to navigate the site easily, it can be considered a success.

The team members must work together to make sure that the application can demonstrate their skills in data manipulation and provide an enjoyable and easy-to-use experience. They should also show how they can work as a team.

## Context
Everyone at this time has the required knowledge to make this project work, we would like to see all pages implemented at the end of November and having all the functionality at the first of December.
