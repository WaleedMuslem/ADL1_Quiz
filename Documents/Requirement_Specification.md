## Project name
The project name is : QUIZ 

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to make a website that will let the user create an account on which he will gain access to the features of our website.

We chose Visual Studio Code"VSCode" as a text editor or an IDE to use and make our project not only because it is simple and straight forward to work on, but very familiar for us to work with too as we already managed projects with its help in the past.

Our web application can let the user create his/her own account which grants access to the index page where all of the available content will be displaced for choice. The user will be able to resolve different quizzes and see his results upon completing them.

## Intended audience
Intended to be used by anyone who is interested in resolving quizzes of different difficulties composed of a multitude of questions on a plethora of topics.

The types of questionnaires differ on the type of their content, for example: economic, politic, scientific, sport-related etc. They also can be of various difficulties, having questions from basic to advanced levels.

Starting from the user logging on the application to access the list of available quizzes to complete then choosing the one they want to and getting redirected to the page with its content, and ending with the detailed designing of the pages, everything should be not only functionally plausible, but aesthetically pleasing for the connected users too.

## User Needs
To use this web page, user needs to find the web page in any browser by using the name of the page, then the user can see the front of the web page which has a sign up and log in place so in order to register the user need to fill out his/her username which is email and enter password than log in.

When a user logs in he/she can see the main page of the web application.
then the user can see the quizzes and choose one and solve it,then the result should appear 

## System rules, patterns, recommendations
For this project we will use HTML and CSS and PHP for the front in ,
basically for create a web page , for every problem ,
we meet , we will try to find good solution for it ,
we will try to use good technology, such as visual studio code ,
and some other compiler would also be fine for us, css and html will be the main languages we use.

## Current business flow model

Currently internet quizzes are far better than the real ones, as they don't require paper and don't create a hassle if they are being conducted in a speech. Because of this, there already exist lots of websites that either implemented quizzes or fully consist of quizzes. The market seems flooded, but the quiz website face a downside that equally grounds them at the same level - the lack of advertisements, which in turn makes those services seemingly unknown and easily rivaled in terms of popularity.

## Project outline
This project will make junior developers increasing his/her knowledge and make them work as a team and 
allow them to contribute a lot to the projects' development.
by using classes and id we can divide the work into neat bundles of code ,
which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable.
The work should use simple functionality that will make code neater throughout the entire project 
so the project will be a very simple one.

## Current situation
As it is known that advances in technology and the rapid delivery of quiz to all parts of the world ,
 so we came up with this idea to create a website specialized in publishing quizs.

 We have decided what the project will look like and have a team of 3 people working on it.

## Goal
Getting used to working in a project is one of the most important steps that a person should take when they start working in the software industry. There are a variety of tools that can help them manage their projects, such as Git, Trello, and GitLab.

The goal of this program is to provide participants with the necessary skills to succeed in today's volatile world, where technology is constantly improving and constantly changing. It will also help them make the life of their admin easier.

We also want to make sure that the application is not only about the manipulation of the experience, but also the ease of use of the website. This is because if a user enjoys the design and is able to navigate the site easily, it can be considered a success.

The team members must work together to make sure that the application can demonstrate their skills in data manipulation and provide an enjoyable and easy-to-use experience. They should also show how they can work as a team.
